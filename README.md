# LLM Fine-Tuning with VSM-ACTR cognitive agents

This repository contains code for **fine-tuning large language models (LLMs)** using **cognitive traces generated by the VSM-ACTR cognitive models**. The goal is to integrate symbolic cognitive modeling with neural language models to build **human-like decision-making agents**.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

- **VSM-ACTR** simulates human decision-making processes and produces cognitive traces.  
- These traces are then used to fine-tune LLMs.
- Models are evaluated using predictive accuracy and negative log-likelihood (NLL) in ground truth human decisions.
