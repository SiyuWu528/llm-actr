# Cognitive LLM Fine-Tuning with VSM-ACTR Traces

This repository contains code for **fine-tuning large language models (LLMs)** using **cognitive traces generated by the VSM-ACTR cognitive architecture**. The goal is to integrate symbolic cognitive modeling with neural language models to build **human-like decision-making agents**.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

- **VSM-ACTR** simulates human decision-making processes and produces cognitive traces.  
- These traces are then used to fine-tune LLMs, enabling them to reason and act more like humans.
